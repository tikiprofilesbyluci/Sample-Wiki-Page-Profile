# Sample Wiki Page Profile
Based on https://themes.tiki.org/Sample+page (thanks Gary!).
Applying this profile will create a sample wiki page in your Tiki with examples of some wiki syntax and wiki plugins to see how they actually render. You can check the following wiki page for a preview: https://profiles.luciash.eu/Sample+Wiki+Page

## Download
Get the released package from the Releases on Github (https://github.com/tikiprofilesbyluci/Sample-Wiki-Page-Profile).

## Installation
How to install (aka apply) the profile?  
You will need an access to your command line on your localhost or via SSH on the server where your Tiki is installed. Unpack the profile somewhere, e.g. you can create new dir named `profiles` in your Tiki site root folder. Then run the following command in your terminal to apply it:  
`php console.php profile:apply profiles/ProfileName`

Alternatively (if you prefer GUI or have no command line access) you can install it directly from your Tiki by adding the profiles.luciash.eu profiles repository to your Profiles control panel.
